Have you ever found yourself spending considerable time converting/compressing and individually checking a large batch of images to ensure they meet [MovieStillsDB](https://www.moviestillsdb.com/)'s standards before uploading? If your answer is yes, then this tool is tailor-made for you!

This tool efficiently converts and compresses multiple images simultaneously to adhere to MovieStillsDB's standards. It resizes images exceeding 7500 pixels in width or height while maintaining the original aspect ratio. Additionally, it compresses files larger than 7.5 MB without compromising quality and seamlessly converts various formats, including jpeg, png, tif, tiff, and raw files, to jpg, ensuring they're ready for hassle-free uploads.

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/niccoloc0/MSDBConverter/releases) of the tool (MSDBConverter.exe) and place it in a folder of your choice. When you run the program, a 'ToConvert' folder will be created. Place the images you want to convert inside this folder and run the program again. The converted files will be placed in a newly created 'Converted' folder, which will contain another folder named with the current date and time. Inside this final folder, you'll find the converted images.
